# Ardour Meta

This project is for augmenting Ardour with a content management system.

## TODO

- configure xdg-open to react to a special url instead of having lua call an executable
- Ardour should list ranges and allow you to click to locate
- move *all* related files/projects into this repo, including lua, etc., and create an intelligent makefile to install everything in the right places
- cli should wrap web postgres-backed web service instead of local sqlite
